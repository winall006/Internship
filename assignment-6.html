<h1> Day-6 </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
              <p> Day6 of internship was exciting as expected.Today i learned about some basic stuffs about computers,electronic chips and number system. </p>

<h2> Basics of computer </h2>
                     <p> Today i got to know about the basic structure of the computer.A computer is system which has a processor and memeory.when the input is given it gets stored in the memory and processed by the processor and the result is given out as the output.then got some insights about the evolution of the computers.initially computers were mechanical in nature then it got evolved into electrical and electronic in nature and got some inputs how they are transforming into quantum computers </p>

                    <p> Learned about how on and off switch in an electric circuit evolved into one and zero of binary number system which forms the basic fundamental unit of a computer called bit.Got to know about morse code which are being used in telegraph.Since eight bit forms a byte we were asked to find why specifically "8" but still searching answer for that i hope i will find that soon.Then got some insights about ascii and unicode </p>
                 
                    <p> Learned about some basic stuffs about chips and micro processor.got some insights on transistors and diodes </p>

<h2> Number System </h2>
                   <p> Got to learn about unary ,binary and decimal number systems and about babylonian number system which forms the basis for 360 degrees of the circle and also for the number of days in an year.</p>

                   <p> Then we were given a task to add two numbers by a machine which just knows how to store and count.We as a team tried to find the solution .As a team we tried to understand the problem.This problem specially has limited operations so tried to list all the possible opeartions.Since the machine doesnt know how to add we tried to workoout some alternate ways to find the solutionwe tried to store the numbers in a variable and tried to count a number by the times of other numberbut we were informed that this is not the expected solution.So still we are figuring out how this problem can be solved.</p>

<h2> Stuffs learned today </h2>
                  <p> Todays internship really builded up things on existing problem solving skills.we were exposed to solve a problem which really had very few limited operations so it made us to think in more of unconventional way to find the solution.i tried to explore unusual ways to list all opertions and figure out the solution. </p>
