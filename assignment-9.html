<h1> Day9 </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
   <p> Day 9 of internship was interesting and exciting as usual.i got to learn more new dimensions about solving problems.</p>

<h2> Things learned from todays session </h2>

 <h3> Table Problem </h3>
                   <p> Today we were informed about the solution for this problem, we got to learn many new stuffs about breaking down of problem.We actually broke down the problem in the wrong way without actually considering all the conditions given.We learned how breaking down a problem in the right way is key to conclude a solution.we alse learned how a problem has to be broken down in a formalised manner considering all the constraints and conditions given. </p>

<h3> Tom and jerry problem </h3>                  
                    <p> Even though we found this solution for this particular problem,we couldnt present a formalised algorithm for this problem.The solution really helped us to understand the process of formalised approach to conclude the solution.I learned how  figuring out the most constrained part can make any problem a piece of cake to solve.even learned how figuring out unnnecessary operations and eliminating it can really get us close to the solution.And also learned how breaking down the problem in the right way can help us to figure out unnecessary operations. </p>
