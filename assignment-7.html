<h1> Day8 </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
              Day 8 was exciting and interesting as usual.Since we didnt solve previous problems we were asked to solve those as a team today

<h2> Addition Puzzle </h2>
              We as a team started from the scratch to solve this.Since we were informed that this problem is not  solvable using count and store operation.Comparative operator was given as a additional option for us.So we started solving this problem using count,store and comparative opertor.We tried to figure out all the possible operations within the given limitations.we tried to use all the given operators to conclude the solution.Since we were asked to write the algorithms it made us to think step by step in a  formalised manner to arrive at the solution.

              We tried to think unconventionally by having a dummy variable to compare and count in order to conclude the solution.We processed each step formally in order to write the algorithms.Finally using all three operators we arrived at a solution.Solving this problem really taught us how to approach a problem unconvenionally when the possible operations are very limited.
