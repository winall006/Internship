<h1> Day4 </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
       <p>  Day 4 of internship was really exciting as expected. we learned about many interesting stuffs which would really enhance my learning curve.</p>

<h2> Things learned from puzzle </h2>
         <p>   After getting know that the puzzle cant be solved i tried to figure out why it cant be resolved and even tried to think out of box to solve this. each piece of land was connected by 3 bridges except one which was connected by five bridges.this 3 and 5 bridges kept fuzzing in my mind which i thought it could be a reason why the problem cannot be solved.Because in the past i had tried solving this kind of problems where these kind of numbers and theories based on these numbers used to be the reason why some problems cannot be solved.we were informed that eulers theorem being the reason why this cant be solved.so the reason was kind of similar which i thought.This puzzle taught me  to question certain problems whether it could be solved or not while in the process of solving it.and to think why it cant be solved when you figure out the problem is insolvable. </p>

        <p>  Then we were introduced about hamilton theory and we were asked to solve two more puzzles based on that. though the puzzle were simple and easy i learned how the problem can be approached differently moving out from the regular way of solving problems.initially i was thinking too complicated as if it was a complex problem.after taking some time and breaking down the question i got some clarity about the question.after getting some clarity i changed my approach towards the puzzle and tried to think as simple as i can .then i could find the solution in the matter of time. </p>

<h2> Markup language <h2>
         <p>    Learned very briefly about markup language and also about different kind of markup languages.today learned some basic stuffs about XML and its extension HTML.then we were given a task to write our language in XML.initally had no idea what does it mean .after thinking for some time and having some discussions with the team mates.i got some clarity about the task.so by doing this task i got some idea how a language can be wriiten with our own choice of words.we decided to use our creativity to make things interesting .so we decided to write up a language using alcohol brands. </p>

        <p>    Then we had a long discussion whether to have groupings in a document which includes title and the paragraphs.initally i doesnt know what does grouping means after clarifing with arun i got some clarity about the discussion.i have a opinion that the document itself a group and adding a grouping inside will make things little complicated.i believe that approaching any thing in a simple way can make life easy .so i differed with the opinion had by arun.
