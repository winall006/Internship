<h1> Weekly Report </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>
                 First Week of internship was interesting and exciting as expected.I got to learn many cool and interesting stuffs.The focus of internship was more on enhancing problem solving skill and briefing more on some basic fundamentals of computers and programming.

<h2> Day1 </h2>
        On the first day i got to know more about different kind of skills needed to be a efficient  programmer.Skills like reading and writing helps us to widen our knowledge.Mathematical thinking and problem solving helps us to enhance our reasoning capability.Breaking down of problem will help us to break a complex problem into many simple pieces of problem.Reasearching helps us to gather more information which helps in giving more clarity.Creativity is an another important skill which makes us to think in unconventional ways to solve a problem.We were given many problems and puzzles to solve which really enhanced my problem solving skills which was lying dormant in back of my mind.

           We got more exposure on skill development and how it gets evolved.Initally we will be a novice as the days go by we got to learn many new stuffs each day and our skills will be enhanced by learning stuffs in bits and pieces throughout the progress.As we proceed and acculmate skills we wil be end up being an expert.

<h2> Day2 </h2>
          On second day we learned more about problem solving.Problem solving requies a holistic approach to understand the problem better.while solving we should be cautious enough to identify all the constraints.we got to know how breaking down of problems allows us to deal with complex problems with simple approach.The most efficient way to solve a problem is to find the most constrained part and breaking down of problem.Trail and error method helps to figure out possible operations and increases our probablity to conclude our solution.Then we got some brief introduction about git and how to upload files into git.

<h2> Day3 </h2>
         On third day we learned about words and how it tries to convey ideas which are formed by gathering information in the past.we got exposed more about problem solving and solutions.Solutions are concluded when all constraints are met and we should make sure the solution is formalised.we got to know about different classes of problems and their categories.

<h2> Day4 </h2>
          On fourth day we learned again more on problem solving and to figure out whether this problem is solvable or not while approaching it.We got to know more about theorems which are helpful in solving problems.Then we got brief introduction about markup languages.
