<h2> Introduction </h2>
                 <p> Day12 of internship was exciting and interesting as expected.Today we get to know more about symbols,tokens and blocks. and also about machine learning and artifical intelligence </p>

<h2> Things learned from todays session </h2>
                  <p> Today i got to learn how spacing between words plays an important role to recognise words in a sentence.spacing helps in spliting up words which resultsin words getting their complete meaning which it deserves.Even i got to know about the rules and pattern which has to be followed which writing a sentence.  </p>

                  <p> We got to know more about the importance of machine learning and artifical intelligence.and got some glimpses how machine learning is changing the status quo nature of present technology and programming.I understood how automation is disturting the present structure of information technology.and also understood how problem solving can play a key role in helping us to survive the transition phase.</p>
